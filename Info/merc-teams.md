## Mercenary Teams

### Time Reduction

Each mission can have up to 3 suggested field skills.
If you assign blades with these field skills to the mission, the time required to complete the mission will be reduced.

For each skill level, 6% of the original mission time will be removed, up to a maximum reduction of 75%.
The resulting value is rounded down to the next whole minute.
This means that 12 or 13 skill levels are required to get the shortest mission time in most cases.

If a blade has multiple suggested field skills, they will all be applied to the time reduction. 
The total field skill is calculated by summing the skill levels (1-5) of each blade, rather than by summing the number of blades with a suggested skill as the in-game UI might suggest.
