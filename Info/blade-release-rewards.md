# Blade Release Rewards

When releasing a blade you will receive a reward based on the number of crowns the blade has, and the state of the blade's affinity chart.

For each crown, there are 6 reward levels. The 6th level is granted if and only if the blade has a complete affinity chart.
Otherwise, the reward level is based on how many of the 5 key affinity nodes the blade has unlocked. 

Except for 4-crown blades with a complete chart, a certain number of boosters will be rewarded as listed in the chart below.

Of these boosters, half (rounded up) will correspond to the element of the released blade. The types of the remaining boosters will each be chosen at random.
Each of the 4 types has an equal chance of being selected.
